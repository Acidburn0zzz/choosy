</span></a>Why</h3>

<p>People will love your app even more if it helps them use their other favorite apps. We're essentially solving the iOS' lack of default app selection mechanism.</p>

<p>Once Choosy is widely implemented, end users will be able to traverse the iOS ecosystem using just the apps they love, be they built-in ones or not.</p>

<!-- <h3>
<a name="a-picture-is-worth-" class="anchor" href="#a-picture-is-worth-"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
</a>Imagine... </h3>

<p>No Choosy: your WebView is forced to have an 'Open in Safari' button, but this particular user loves Chrome. *the sound of a quiet, devoid-of-hope sigh from user*</p>
With Choosy: your button says 'Open in Browser'. When the button is tapped, Choosy displays a list of installed browsers, such as Safari and Chrome.
If a user selects Chrome, the button now says 'Open in Chrome' and sends the user to that browser. *the sound of a grin and a great review being typed!* </p>

<!-- <p>No Choosy: your About screen has Email Us link, but your user loves Mailbox. *wishful and slightly sad user face*</p>
<p>Choosy: User is asked for their favorite email client when they tap the Email Us link. *pleasantly surprised and excited user face* </p> -->

<!--<h3>How?</h3>
<p>You don't need to write any code specific to 3rd party apps. Simply tell Choosy what app category you want, and what action (if any) you'd like to perform and with what parameters.
  Choosy will figure out how to pass those parameters to the app user selects, and it will fall back to only passing the parameters the said app supports.
  If the selected app doesn't support that action, Choosy will fall back to just opening that app.</p>
<p>For example, let's say your About page has a twitter link to your company's profile:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>
[SBChoosy registerUIElement:self.companyTwitterLink
                  forAction:[SBChoosyActionContext contextWithAppType:@"Twitter"
                                                               action:@"show_profile"
                                                           parameters:@{ @"profile_screenname" : @"KarlTheFog",
                                                                         @"callback_url" : @"choosyDemoApp://"}]];
</code></pre>
<p>Choosy creates and executes a different URL based on which app user selects, e.g.:</p>
<p>Safari: http://www.twitter.com/KarlTheFog</p>
<p>Twitter: twitter://user?screen_name=KarlTheFog</p>
<p>Tweetbot: tweetbot:///user_profile/KarlTheFog?callback_url=choosyDemoApp://</p> -->

<h3>
<a name="how-easy-to-implement" class="anchor" href="#how-easy-to-implement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
</a>How</h3>

<p>Easy. You have two options.</p>

<h4>
<a name="easiest-" class="anchor" href="#easiest-">
  <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easiest</h4>

<p>In viewDidLoad:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[SBChoosy registerUIElement:self.myButton forAction:[SBChoosyActionContext initWithAppType:@"Twitter"]];
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Choosy will hook up a tap and long press gesture recognizers to that button (or any other UIControl), display the app selection UI, etc.</p>

<h4>
<a name="easier-" class="anchor" href="#easier-">
  <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easier</h4>

<p>In your viewDidLoad or applicationDidLoad: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[SBChoosy registerAppTypes: @[@"Twitter", @"Browser", @"Email", ...]]
</code></pre>

<p>And then call Choosy from your own event handlers:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[SBChoosy handleAction: [SBChoosyActionContext contextWithAppType:@"Email" action:@"Compose" parameters:@{ @"to" : @"choosy@substantial.com" }]];</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="customization" class="anchor" href="#customization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customization</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>
<!--<p>More complex cases:
1. Register a delegate with Choosy. The most important question a delegate can answer is, what is the parent view controller for Choosy's view controller? If the delegate does not respond to that question, but the delegate itself is a view controller, that view controller is used as the parent. But if the delegate is not present at all, Choosy uses top-most (i.e. currently visible) view controller in the Window hierarchy as the parent.</p>-->

<h3>
<a name="how-is-this-possible" class="anchor" href="#how-is-this-possible"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But how...</h3>

<p>Thanks to UIApplication's canOpenURL method and iOS forcing unique url schemes. Basically, we store a list of URL schemes for each app on the server, and categorize apps. Choosy downloads that info as needed.</p>

<p>Choosy caches network data, so the traffic footprint is small. It also instantly knows when a new app from same category is installed, or the default app is deleted, and lets user re-select the default app. Choosy is non-intrusive - if there's no connection and the default app hasn't been selected yet, it just opens the default iOS app.</p>

<h3>When</h3>

<p>
We're at alpha (including the look and feel). Beta should be within 2 weeks, and then it's just a lot of polish - the devil is in the details, as they say. Honestly, we love this, for it truly makes iOS experience better, but we also want to make sure other developers are as excited to implement it. So please let us know what you think at choosy@substantial.com!
