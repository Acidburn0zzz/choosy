        <h3>
<a name="choosy" class="anchor" href="#choosy"><span class="octicon octicon-link">
</span></a>Why</h3>

<p>While many of us at <a href="http://www.substantial.com">Substantial</a> love iOS, we have a commonly-occurring annoyance: we tap a link hoping that it opens our favorite client app (or at least lets us select one) only to be disappointed. It's a flawed user experience, a blemish in the otherwise pretty and elegant iOS.</p>

<p>We have a dream that iOS users can traverse the ecosystem using just the apps they love, be they built-in apps or not. We can't completely solve iOS' current lack of a default app selection mechanism, but all of us together can solve some of it.</p>

<h3>A Video Is Worth a Thousand Words</h3>

</p>

<!-- <h3>Imagine... </h3>

<p>No Choosy: your WebView is forced to have an 'Open in Safari' button, but this particular user loves Chrome. *the sound of a quiet, devoid-of-hope sigh from user*</p>
With Choosy: your button says 'Open in Browser'. When the button is tapped, Choosy displays a list of installed browsers, such as Safari and Chrome.
If a user selects Chrome, the button now says 'Open in Chrome' and sends the user to that browser. *the sound of a grin and a great review being typed!* </p>

<p>No Choosy: your About screen has Email Us link, but your user loves Mailbox. *wishful and slightly sad user face*</p>
<p>Choosy: User is asked for their favorite email client when they tap the Email Us link. *pleasantly surprised and excited user face* </p> -->

<!--<h3>How?</h3>
<p>You don't need to write any code specific to 3rd party apps. Simply tell Choosy what app category you want, and what action (if any) you'd like to perform and with what parameters.
  Choosy will figure out how to pass those parameters to the app user selects, and it will fall back to only passing the parameters the said app supports.
  If the selected app doesn't support that action, Choosy will fall back to just opening that app.</p>
<p>For example, let's say your About page has a twitter link to your company's profile:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>
[Choosy registerUIElement:self.companyTwitterLink
                  forAction:[ChoosyActionContext contextWithAppType:@"Twitter"
                                                               action:@"show_profile"
                                                           parameters:@{ @"profile_screenname" : @"KarlTheFog",
                                                                         @"callback_url" : @"choosyDemoApp://"}]];
</code></pre>
<p>Choosy creates and executes a different URL based on which app user selects, e.g.:</p>
<p>Safari: http://www.twitter.com/KarlTheFog</p>
<p>Twitter: twitter://user?screen_name=KarlTheFog</p>
<p>Tweetbot: tweetbot:///user_profile/KarlTheFog?callback_url=choosyDemoApp://</p> -->

<h3>
<a name="how-easy-to-implement" class="anchor" href="#how-easy-to-implement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
</a>How</h3>

<p>Easy. You have two options.</p>

<h4>
<a name="easiest-" class="anchor" href="#easiest-">
  <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easiest</h4>

<p>In viewDidLoad:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[Choosy registerUIElement:self.myButton forAction:[ChoosyActionContext initWithAppType:@"Twitter"]];
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Choosy will hook up a tap and long press gesture recognizers to that button and display the app selection UI as needed.</p>

<h4>
<a name="easier-" class="anchor" href="#easier-">
  <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easier</h4>

<p>In your controller's viewDidLoad or appDelegate's applicationDidLoad: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[Choosy registerAppTypes: @[@"Twitter", @"Browser", @"Email", ...]]
</code></pre>

<p>You can still use registerUIElement method shown above, but you can also call Choosy from your own event handlers:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>[Choosy handleAction: [ChoosyActionContext actionContextWithAppType:@"Email" action:@"compose" parameters:@{ @"to" : @"choosy@substantial.com" }]];</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="customization" class="anchor" href="#customization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Customizable?</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/substantial/choosy/blob/master/README.md#customizing-the-ui">Yes</a>. (link to README)</p>

<h3>
<a name="how-is-this-possible" class="anchor" href="#how-is-this-possible"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But How...</h3>

<p>All of this relies on UIApplication's canOpenURL method. (Oh the things we could do if we had <em>two</em> API methods!) We store a list of URL schemes and their building blocks for each app on a server (in a <a href="https://github.com/substantial/choosy-data">GitHub repository</a> right now), categorizing apps by type. Choosy downloads that info as needed. Developers code to an app-agnostic interface where they just specify the type of app they are linking to/trying to interact with, and pass in a list of parameters. Choosy maps those parameters to the parameters supported by each app and builds app-specific URLs.</p>

<p>Choosy does cache the data it downloads, so the traffic footprint is minimal. Users can set an app as default; after all, their Twitter client preference is not likely to change from one Twitter link to the next. If a new app of the same type is installed, or the app marked as default is deleted, Choosy presents app choices to the user again the next time a link related to that app type is activated. Finally, the framework is non-intrusive - if there's no connection and the default app hasn't been selected yet, and if Choosy can't download data or no 3rd-party apps are installed yet, it just opens the default iOS app, thus acting as if it wasn't there in the first place.</p>

<h3>What's Next</h3>

<p>
We're now in beta! The core is there, albeit our list of TODOs remains long - the devil is in the details, as they say. And we like polished apps. You can play with the framework now, however, and give us feedback! Please stay tuned to major updates via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/choosyios">@choosyios</a> and feel free to send us feedback, ideas, and requests at <a href="mailto:choosy@substantial.com">choosy@substantial.com</a>. Of course, if you find a bug or want a feature, please open a <a href="https://github.com/substantial/choosy/issues">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
